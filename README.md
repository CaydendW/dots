# dots

My dotfiles for my i3-gaps-rounded setup. The rounded isn't used so i3 gaps will work. Just remove the line that has the roundness in the config. My main shell is fish but my old bashrc has been included. I use konsole as my main terminal and the konsolerc has been included.

This config uses my purps [purps-colorscheme](https://github.com/CaydendW/purps-colorscheme). It match the background included in the i3 config
